# Education and Experience

- **South China Normal University Affiliated High School**（Sep 2018 - Jun 2021）
- **Beijing Normal University**（Sep 2021 – Present）
  - B.Eng. Artificial Intelligence (Innovation Program)
- **RA in Institute of AI and Future Networks**, Beijing Normal University (2023.03 – Present)
  - Conducted federated learning research under the guidance of Tianhui Meng.
  - Participated in the entire research process, including literature reading, group dis- cussions, code writing, conducting experiments, and writing papers.
  - One paper about robust federated learning is submitted to TDSC, another research about HFL is in the experimental phase.

# Skills

- **Languages**：Native in Cantonese & Mandarin, Professional Working Proficiency in English.
- **Coding**: Python, C++, Markdown, Matlab, LATEX, Verilog, . . .
- **Tools**: ChatGPT, Pytorch, Git, Unix Shell, VS Code, Jupyter, DaVinci Resolve, . . .

# Projects

- **Robust Hierarchical Federated Learning** (2023.11 - Present)  
  - Design an efficient and secure semi-synchronous aggregation algorithm in the HFL framework. Now doing possible various attempts to optimize the training process in the HFL framework.
  - As a co-first author, participate in and responsible for algorithm design and optimization, code writing, and article writing.
- **Fed-Credit: Robust Federated Learning with Credibility Management** (2023.03 - 2023.12)  
  - Proposed a robust federated learning framework based on Credibility value to resist various poten- tial attacks during federated learning training.
  - As a co-first author, I participated in and was responsible for algorithm design and optimization, code writing, and article writing.
- **The "[One Lifetime One Chip](https://ysyx.oscc.cc/)" program**  (2023.08 - Present)
  - It’s a program primarily aims to provide participating students with exposure to the entire process of chip development and flow, allowing students to have a RISC-V chip of their own.	
  - I am very interested in the development of AI chips, and I joined immediately after learning about this project. I have currently completed all content in the pre-learning stage, and after passing the defense, I am about to enter the learning phase B & A.
- **Migrating ROS-based VIO algorithms to the openEuler platform** (2022.06 - 2022.10)  
  - A project of [OSPP](https://summer-ospp.ac.cn/ )(Open Source Promotion Plan) 2022, assisted in migrating the SVO(Semi-direct Visual Odometry) algorithm to the OpenEuler operating system basic on Ros.
